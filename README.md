# Machine Learning-based Malware Detection

This repository contains code for training and evaluating various machine learning models for malware detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in the file `uci_malware_detection.csv`. It contains features extracted from malware samples, along with their corresponding labels.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Instructions

1. Download the code and dataset:

   - Click on the green "Code" button above.
   - Select "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a ZIP file.
   - Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a local directory.

2. Install the required dependencies:

   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3.   Run the malware_detection.py script:

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

shell
Copy code
python malware_detection.py

This script will load the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train various machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

4. View the results:
The script will display the accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix for each model. It will also generate a bar plot showing the accuracy of each model.
